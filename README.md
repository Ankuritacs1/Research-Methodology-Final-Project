**Investigating of how to move from a software utilized on premise to cloud Computing through the incorporation of CRM Solutions(v 1.0)**

Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that has continually enabled the users to access computing resources in a more convenient manner. The services are access as pay-per-use services. Different cloud offerings such as Amazon and Google Apps are increasingly obtaining a broader user base to encourage a software migration towards the cloud. However, it is a fact that such offerings are still at their infancy stages. This paper presents a research on investigating how to move from a software utilized on premise to embrace the cloud computing changes through the incorporation of the CRM solutions.

## Project Architectural Overview

Decision Tree:

<img width="483" alt="Decision Tree" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79347871/129222347-fd1e8b27-d508-410b-ab00-27b654ab6253.png">

The tree originates from the enterprise level and divides into two perspectives; embracing cloud computing with CRM and maintaining the software utilized on premise. According to research, transmitting to cloud has its challenges and opportunities. Despite the positive outcomes, it still has challenges such as handling data security, convincing clients to use their program and the CRM breakdown cost among others. On the other hand, researchers argue about maintaining the on premise model because it has its opportunities which include total ownership, complete control and uptime. This area also faces its own challenges. 

Decision Tool using the SWOT Format:

Strengths involved with venturing in cloud computing range from a wide angle. They include high speed; the cloud technology allows fast deployment of services, mobility; to get services, one would only need internet connectivity and operate from any location, automatic software integration; updates occur automatically in the system therefore there is no need for manual activation and reliability; enterprises can instantly get information updates .Although weaknesses in the system still threaten its success. Some of the challenges include; variance in performanceâ€“unpredictability, technical issues may arise as a result of failing to maintain the system and lower bandwidth connection which poses slower service delivery. Researchers acknowledge the favorable opportunities such as low management cost, successful information technology maintenance and high security. However, challenges are also downplaying and hold back the success of the system. These challenges vary from unclear data transparency in administration, resource breach and network breaches such as unwanted entry to the system by hacking.

## Roadmap

I am trying to find a suitable dataset which can be used to create a decision tree using python.That decision tree will be able to help enterprises make their decision whether to go for Cloud based or on-premise software solutions

## Project Status
I am still working on finding the correct dataset to create the model

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my special gratitude to my family who offered enough support during the time of research. Special thanks to my close friends who have proven to be effective in assisting me in finalizing the project within the limited time frame, specifically when it comes to proofreading. I would also like to thank my professor who played an effective role in guiding me in the process of topic selection, to ensure that I remained on the right side of the research.

**How to run the .py file:**

Click on the file and it will ask for your inputs and based on those inputs it will show whether you should go for a on-premise or cloud based solution
